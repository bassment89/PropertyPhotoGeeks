      Originally named "Property Gold Marketing" Our company was founded by Chris Fletcher in 2015. Chris had worked for years as a professional photographer. A change in his career path led him to working at a corporate estate agency in Clapham. He soon noticed that it often took too long to organise photographers for his listings. This resulted in costing the company money, and himself valuable commission. On some occasions, property vendors would go with competing agencies, simply because the photographers couldn't get out for several days. Chris also noticed the pictures he received were great, however not always appropriate for attracting buyers. His photographer eyes also caught other nuance imperfections, for example rooms were often beautified with the table set, but not angled correctly to show off the ample space that they offered.

Why we do what we do</div>
    <div class="description-index-padded">
With Chrisâ€™s background in professional photography and his new career as an up and coming estate agent, he put these skill sets together to create a photography company whose services truly reflected the needs of the clients they were serving.  Focusing on promptness, professionalism and aftercare, Chris vowed to do things differently. Working in both industries really gave Chris an added advantage to see things from the client's point of view.

     As the company gained business and a number of trusted clients it was time to move forward. Chris was unable to handle all the work himself and soon had several freelance photographers helping him carry out his duties.  Mariusz Zawadski was one of the photographers Chris had recruited that distinctly stood out from the crowd.  Mariusz is an artist at heart and had developed a love for photography whilst he was at art school.  As a member of the photographers association in Poland, he had gained much experience in the industry working as a photojournalist for a newspaper, and covering other important events including weddings and social gatherings.  In searching for new work opportunities in the UK, he connected with Chris and took to property photography like a duck to water. He developed a love for turning the property market into beautiful photography admired by his clients.  Chris was well aware of Marius's great work, dedication, attention to detail and professionalism and started to think big...

All coming together</div>
     <div class="description-index-padded">
Chris had to make a decision. Was he happy with a handful of exceptionally content clients and a nice business or could he use his knowledge, contacts and expertise to  expand and serve the forever hungry property market. He decided to go for the latter.  Firstly he brought Mariusz on board the company due to his reputable work and high standards. In order to help increase his client base he also recruited an old friend, Raj Singh. Raj had a wealth of sales experience in the travel industry, but also brought additional skills obtained in tourism management. His customer focused experience, management skills and own personal interest in property investment was the final piece of the pie on the creation of this company. This new energy demanded a rebrand to put us on the map. Property photo geeks seemed like a perfect summary of the company's credentials, and the company was reborn in Winter 2022 under the new name.  Together, they formed a formidable team and are now ready to grow and take on more clients, challenging the complacent nature of the industry they were in.
